# Med-School-Questions

This is a public repository for medical school style questions broken down by subject and topic. 

For optimal use, you should read up on the topic you wish to practice on before taking these quizzes.
Once you feel comfortable with the material, take the quiz.
Compare your answers to those on the key.
I have painstakingly researched to the best of my knowledge the reasonings behind the correct and incorrect answers.

I hope these resources help you succeed in whatever studies you are pursuing.

Good luck!
